# Choreo
Choreo is an open-source visual tool for creating games and software.  Aimed at "casual" software development (students, hobbyists, tinkerers), it nonetheless supports the creation of "real" applications, distributable online or in executable form, across many devices.  Choreo seeks to close the gap between "easy" introductions to programming and professional software development.  Visual tools almost always get in programmers' way, but projects like MIT's Scratch and UC Berkeley's BYOB show that programming environments can be visual without sacrificing expressiveness.  Initially a tool for education and game development, over time we hope Choreo evolves into a more sophisticated way of assembling software applications and services.  In 2050, will be still be building software by typing curly braces into a text editor?
